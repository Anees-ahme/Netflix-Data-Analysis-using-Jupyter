I've recently completed an extensive data analysis on a Netflix dataset, employing a variety of techniques to explore and gain insights. Here’s a brief overview of what I’ve accomplished:

Data Preparation:

Imported necessary libraries.
Loaded the dataset.
Checked data types of columns and used the head() function to display the top 5 records.
Dataset Overview:

Displayed the number of rows and columns.
Showed the total number of records and columns.
Provided detailed information about the dataset.
Data Cleaning:

Checked for and handled duplicate records.
Verified the presence of null values and visualized them using a seaborn heatmap.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examined specific columns such as 'title'.
Checked for the presence of the title 'Zubaan'.
Located specific records based on certain criteria.
Feature Engineering:

Created a new column "R_Date" to capture the release year.
Analyzed the new column to determine the year with the highest number of movie releases using dt.year.value_counts().
Visualizations:

Used seaborn to generate insightful heatmaps and other visualizations.
This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided valuable insights into the trends and patterns within the Netflix dataset. I’m thrilled to continue exploring and learning in the field of data science!# Netflix-Data-Analysis-using-Jupyter
